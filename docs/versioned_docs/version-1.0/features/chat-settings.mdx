# Chat Settings & Commands

Stream Slugger allows your viewers to interact directly with your game in real-time through a variety of **chat commands** and **streamer-controlled toggles**.

## ⚙️ Chat Toggles

The following features can be toggled on or off in the Stream Slugger interface.

### 1. Enable Boss Spawning

- **Description**: Allows chat to spawn powerful **Boss Characters** in-game.
- **Command**: `!boss`
- **Default State**: Disabled
- **Function**:
  - Viewers can use `!boss` in chat to spawn a boss.
  - A limit can be set (e.g., max 2 bosses at once).
- **Recommended Usage**: Start with this OFF to let the streamer control the pacing of the game.

> ✅ **Pro Tip**: Boss battles are great for big moments in your stream!

### 2. Enable Chat Healing

- **Description**: Viewers can support the streamer by spawning **healing balls**.
- **Command**: `!heal`
- **Default State**: Disabled
- **Function**:
  - Chat can type `!heal` to drop a healing orb the player can collect.
  - Useful in difficult battles or survival runs.

### 3. Character Chat Balloons

- **Description**: Shows a **speech balloon** over in-game characters when chat commands are used.
- **Default State**: Enabled
- **Function**:
  - When enabled, in-game characters will display chat messages above their heads (e.g., for `!boss` or `!heal`).
- **Note**:  
  In version **1.1.2**, toggle settings are **not retained** after closing the application. You’ll need to re-enable them on each launch.
